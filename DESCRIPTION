Description: A S4 class has been created such that complex operations can be
    executed on each cells of a raster map. The raster of objects contains the
    traditional raster map with the addition of a list of generic objects: one
    object for each raster cells. It allows to write few lines of R code for complex
    map algebra. Two environmental applications about frequency analysis of raster
    map of precipitation and creation of a raster map of soil water retention curves
    have been presented.
